            FXSheikh was recommended from the consultants we used for our
            rebranding. From the beginning at the consultation they asked us
            deep questions about our business. They understood the vision I had
            for my business

            engaded fxsheikh six years earlier to establish a basic online
            presence</h1>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">
            Top Ryde Barber Shop is a Sydney based barber shop offering the full
            suite of barber services, from styled cuts, hot towel shaves, all
            the way to cutting edge razor fades. The business had come out of
            the COVID 19 pandemic slightly batter and bruised.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">
            A beloved business in the community, and loved by its customers, the
            business had been in operation for over 50 years, with the current
            Head Barber, Sam, taking over in 2006.

            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">The site was looking dated, with the
                design needing to be modernised as part of a business rebrand</h1>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">The owner Sam was happy with
            the business being brought in by the initial site, and the google
            presence, getting customers from over 50km from their store. But he
            wanted to improve the design whilst maintaining the existing
            simplicity</p>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">As part of a rebranding
            strategy, where the business wanted to price according to the
            premium service they were providing, they wanted a clean and modern
            design to reflect their new branding.</p>
