          <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">
            A beloved business in the community, and loved by its customers, the
            business had been in operation for over 50 years, with the current
            Head Barber, Sam, taking over in 2006.

          <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">
            The site was looking dated, with the design needing to be modernised
            as part of a business rebrand
          </h1>
          <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">
            The owner Sam was happy with the business being brought in by the
            initial site, and the google presence, getting customers from over
            50km from their store. But he wanted to improve the design whilst
            maintaining the existing simplicity
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">
            As part of a rebranding strategy, where the business wanted to price
            according to the premium service they were providing, they wanted a
            clean and modern design to reflect their new branding.

          <h3 class="text-lg pt-10 text-gray-800 uppercase">The Solution</h3>
          <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">
            The team conducted workshops to establish the customer journey,
            built paper prototypes, and wireframes to inform the final clean
            design
          </h1>
          <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">
            FXSheikh ran an in depth workshop with the client, getting to
            understand what the vision for the business was, what they wanted
            their ideal customer to look like and take away from the site. We
            went through our development process, designing on paper and post it
            notes and creating low fidelity wireframes. We also decided that we
            wanted to retain the top 3 position in search results on google.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">
            As part of the build process we used html, css, and tailwindcss for
            design, combined with depolyment on the netlify platform so the site
            would be served closest to users coming to the site.

          </h1>
          <p class="text-md text-gray-700 pt-10">
            The client was extremely satisfied with the result, with a top 2
            position in search results for barber in the area, the site also saw
            an increase of 350% of monthly active users. The owner saw an
            increase of over 10% in incremental revenue due to the site
            redesign.
